// never on /v1: a client holding an API key must not bypass load balancing or
// a PD deployment's two-stage handoff (plan D9). On a PD deployment a pinned
// request goes to that instance alone, which is not an end-to-end result.

// load balancing path accounts the same refusal rather than as a plain 5xx.

	// the asleep counter and hide a real outage.
