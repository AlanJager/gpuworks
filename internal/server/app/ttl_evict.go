// evictBoundedLocked and sweepExpiredLocked implement the eviction policy
// shared by observability's two TTL-keyed maps: the deployment-label
// resolver cache (deployCache) and the quantile-at-ingest bucket-vector
// state (bucketState). Both used to run a full sweep-then-sort.Slice pass
// every time a single entry was inserted (deploymentFor / foldBucketGroup);
// at fleet scale that meant one full-map sort per resolved instance or per
// histogram group within a batch - up to thousands of times per ingest tick
// - and once the map was actually at capacity, every one of those calls paid
// the expensive path. Measured: 1000 instances x 6 histogram families at a
// 4096 cap cost 14.8s per tick and dropped 68% of gauges (entries evicted
// mid-batch before they could be diffed against their previous tick).
//
// The fix has two parts, matching the two functions here:
//   - The full O(n) "delete everything already expired" sweep is cheap in
//     isolation but must not run on every insert; it is instead called once
//     per metricsIngestLoop observe tick (every 5s - the TTLs involved are
//     30s and 10m, so that cadence is still far more frequent than needed).
//   - The "still over cap after sweeping" fallback no longer sorts the whole
//     map: it selects exactly the entries to evict via a bounded max-heap
//     (O(n log k), k = the number evicted) instead of sort.Slice (O(n log
//     n) regardless of how far over cap the map is), and callers invoke it
//     once per batch (writeMetricsBatch / applyQuantiles), not once per
//     entry inserted within it.

// evictBoundedLocked trims m to at most limit entries, preferring to drop
// the entries nearest to expiry (the same ordering as "oldest inserted",
// since every entry in these maps shares one TTL). It does not check
// expiry itself - see sweepExpiredLocked for that - so between periodic
// sweeps a churning fleet can go over cap purely on insert volume, and this
// is the bounded fallback for that case. Callers must hold the map's own
// mutex. Returns the number of entries evicted, so a caller can add it to an
// observable counter: unlike sweepExpiredLocked's routine cleanup of
// already-dead entries, an over-cap eviction here is discarding an entry
// that was still live, i.e. real data loss under sustained over-capacity
// load, and worth surfacing rather than only inferring from silence.
