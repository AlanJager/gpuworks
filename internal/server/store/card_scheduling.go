// An operator's say over one card, the way NodeScheduling is over a node.
//
// Two decisions, both the operator's and both above the platform's verdict
// (docs/adr/0060-card-health-from-hardware-facts.md):
//
//   - Stopping a card's scheduling holds until the operator says otherwise.
//     Nothing the platform sees lifts it.
//   - Putting a card the platform judged unusable (a fault, or a process
//     outside the platform) back into scheduling lets work onto it until the
//     next report at least cardAllowanceWindow later, which judges the card
//     afresh. That is long enough to place a deployment by hand and see
//     whether the card really cannot serve; a card still faulty is stopped
//     again by that report, a card that recovered simply stays schedulable.

// cardAllowanceWindow is the least time an operator's allowance lasts. A
// report every minute would otherwise leave anything from a second to a
// minute, depending on when the operator clicked.
