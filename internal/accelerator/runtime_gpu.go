// Whether a container runtime needs a vendor plugin to give a container
// accelerators, which is vendor knowledge and so belongs here.
//
// It differs per vendor and per runtime, and getting it wrong in either
// direction is costly: demanding a plugin that is not needed takes a
// working node out of service, and not demanding one that is leaves every
// deployment on the node failing at container start with an error from the
// runtime that names no cause.

// Whether a vendor's runtime can be asked on the host whether it can
// actually use a card is not stated here: that depends on which library and
// CLI the agent would have to call, which is agent mechanism rather than
// vendor identity. The agent's gpu.HostRuntimeCheckFor is the one place that
// knows it.

// Why a runtime cannot give a container this node's accelerators. Codes
// rather than sentences, so the text an operator reads is in their own
// language (the plugin itself is named by RuntimeGPUPlugin).
//
// They are two codes because the remedy differs: one is "install the
// vendor's plugin", the other "configure the daemon you already have".

	// with, and treating it as readiness is what let unconfigured nodes
	// take deployments that then failed at container start.

//   - Hygon and PPU expose their cards by device passthrough, which the
