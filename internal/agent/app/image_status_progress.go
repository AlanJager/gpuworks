// must not hold the node's single image slot forever: the transfer fails
// visibly instead of blocking every later one behind it.
// It is a backstop, not the first line of defence: an operator can cancel a
// transfer, and the server abandons one that stops reporting. This bounds the
// node's image slot even when nobody is watching.
