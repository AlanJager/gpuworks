// resolveBoundCards rewrites the spec's device indexes to the ones the cards
// it is bound to carry right now. The server binds an instance to hardware
// identities (accelerator.CardIdent) because a device index numbers only the
// cards the driver could initialize: when one fails to initialize, is passed
// through to a VM, or is added, every later card shifts down or up and the
// index the instance was placed with would name a different card — one that
// may already be serving another instance.
//
// Everything downstream (device injection, dGPU partitioning, udocker's
// device nodes) keeps working in indexes, which is what the vendor runtimes
// actually take; this is the one place identity is turned back into them.
//
// A spec without identities comes from a server that predates them, or from
// a prober that reports neither a PCI address nor a UUID; it is used as it
// is. A card that cannot be found fails the launch: starting on whichever
// card now holds that index is the failure this exists to prevent.
